<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**About Me**</span>\\
Welcome to my website! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Ryan O'Donnell](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/). Previously, I was an undergraduate at Duke University, where I got my B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science and was fortunate to be advised by [Benjamin Rossman](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~br148/) and [Debmalya Panigrahi](https://www.debmalyapanigrahi.org/).

My research interests lie in theoretical computer science. Recently I have been thinking about problems in pseudorandomness and Markov chain mixing. As an undergraduate I worked on circuit complexity and graph algorithms.

Outside of research, I enjoy playing basketball, attempting to climb rocks, and watching movies.

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**Teaching**</span>\\
In Spring 2024 I am a TA for 15-751 (CS Theory Toolkit).

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**Other**</span>\\
In Fall 2023 I co-organized a [reading group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PBddwr6dMlV5Cl93Ghq1CPrqcg8wWZS1KQBvxfygGfM/edit) on high-dimensional expanders.

In Fall 2023 I was a Session Leader for the [CMU TechNights](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/technights/) program.
