<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**About Me**</span>\\
Welcome to my website! I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Ryan O'Donnell](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/). Previously, I was an undergraduate at Duke University, where I got my B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science and was fortunate to be advised by [Benjamin Rossman](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~br148/) and [Debmalya Panigrahi](https://www.debmalyapanigrahi.org/).

My research interests lie broadly in the intersection of theoretical computer science and probability theory. Recently I have been working on quantum statistics and algorithms for approximate counting/sampling. As an undergraduate I worked on circuit complexity and graph algorithms.

Outside of research, I enjoy playing basketball, playing tennis, and watching movies.
